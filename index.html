					<p>Case Study:</p>
					<h4>The Healthiest Year of My Life</h4>
					<p>Databetes founder Doug Kanter closely tracked all his diabetes data for a full year. As a result, he was able to improve his A1c readings by nearly a full point.</p>

				<h3>New ways to learn from your data</h3>
				<p>Patients are benefitting more each day from increasingly accurate medical devices, activity trackers and other data. Yet the daily challenges of living with diabetes remain. We want to help make all this data actionable, empowering patients to make better self-management decisions and achieve better control of their diabetes.</p>

				<p>To do that, Databetes is developing software that integrates both medical readings and lifestyle data, such as nutrition and activity. Presenting this data together helps patients contextualize their readings and better understand blood sugar trends.</p>

				<p>We’re starting with Meal Memory, but will soon be offering more services to help diabetes patients manage their condition, In the meantime, we’d love to hear from you. What’s the biggest challenge for you as a patient?</p>
